# 0x00. Python - Hello, World

## Description
This project introduces the basics of Python programming. It covers various tasks such as running Python scripts, printing text and variables, and using Python-specific features like f-strings. It also focuses on understanding basic Python syntax and best practices for writing Pythonic code.

## Requirements

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Editors | vi, vim, emacs |
| Compilation | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5) |
| File Endings | All files should end with a new line |
| README | A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory |
| Coding Style | PEP8 (pycodestyle) |
| Global Variables | Not allowed |
| Functions per File | No more than 5 |
| Allowed Python Standard Library Functions | print, input |
| Header File | N/A (pure Python project) |

## Python Coding Guidelines
- All Python scripts must be executable.
- All scripts should begin with `#!/usr/bin/python3` as the first line.
- Your Python code should use the `pycodestyle` version 2.8.* for linting.
- You should handle errors gracefully and avoid crashing the script for unhandled exceptions.

## Tasks

| Task | Description | File |
|------|-------------|------|
| 0 | Write a Shell script that runs a Python script stored in the environment variable `PYFILE`. | 0-run |
| 1 | Write a Shell script that runs Python code stored in the environment variable `PYCODE`. | 1-run_inline |
| 2 | Write a Python script that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"`. | 2-print.py |
| 3 | Complete a Python script that prints an integer followed by `Battery street`. | 3-print_number.py |
| 4 | Complete a Python script to print a float with a precision of 2 digits. | 4-print_float.py |
| 5 | Write a Python script that prints 3 times a string, followed by its first 9 characters. | 5-print_string.py |
| 6 | Concatenate two strings to print "Welcome to Holberton School!". | 6-concat.py |
| 7 | Slice a word to print specific characters of the string `word`. | 7-edges.py |
| 8 | Create a new sentence by concatenating multiple slices of strings. | 8-concat_edges.py |
| 9 | Write a Python script that prints the Zen of Python by Tim Peters. | 9-easter_egg.py |
| 10 | Write a Python script that checks for errors using `pycodestyle`. | 10-check_errors.py |

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the basics of Python programming and why Python is considered awesome.
- Use Python to write basic scripts.
- Learn how to use Python's string formatting techniques.
- Explore Python's built-in functions and standard library features.
- Familiarize yourself with Python's coding style and best practices, including PEP8 (pycodestyle).

# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Description
This project delves into Python's core data structures: **lists** and **tuples**. The focus is on understanding how these data structures work, their common methods, and when to use them effectively. By the end of this project, you will be proficient in handling lists and tuples, performing operations on them, and understanding how they differ from strings and other sequence types.

## Requirements

| **Category**       | **Details**                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Editors**        | `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`                                     |
| **Interpreter**    | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Python 3 (version 3.8.5)               |
| **File Endings**   | All files should end with a new line                     |
| **README**         | A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory |
| **Coding Style**   | Follow **PEP8** (pycodestyle)                            |
| **Global Variables**| Not allowed                                             |
| **Functions per File** | No more than 5 functions per file                    |
| **Allowed Functions** | `print`, `len`, `append`, `insert`, `pop`, `remove`, `reverse`, `sort`, `dir`, `range` |
| **Header File**    | N/A (pure Python project)                                |

## Python Coding Guidelines
- All Python scripts must be executable.
- Scripts should begin with `#!/usr/bin/python3` as the first line.
- Python code must comply with **pycodestyle** version 2.8.\*.
- Scripts should handle lists and tuples appropriately using native methods and operations.
- Code must not be executed when imported (use `if __name__ == "__main__":`).

## 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Description

This project explores advanced Python data structures such as sets and dictionaries. You'll learn how to manipulate these structures for optimized data storage and retrieval. The tasks will guide you through operations like set intersections, dictionary manipulations, and other fundamental operations. By the end of this project, you will understand how to effectively use these structures in real-world applications.

| **File Endings**   | All files should end with a new line                                 |
| **README**         | A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory    |
| **Coding Style**   | Follow PEP8 (pycodestyle)                                            |
| **Global Variables**| Not allowed                                                         |

### Python Coding Guidelines
- All Python scripts must be executable.
- Scripts should begin with `#!/usr/bin/python3` as the first line.
- Python code must comply with `pycodestyle` version 2.8.\*.
- Code should handle data structures without altering the original unless specified.
- Efficient use of loops and comprehensions is encouraged for better performance.

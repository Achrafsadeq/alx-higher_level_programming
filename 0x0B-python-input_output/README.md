# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

## Description

This project delves deeper into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, focusing on the concept of inheritance. The tasks are designed to explore various aspects of inheritance, including creating subclasses, overriding methods, and working with multiple inheritance. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of how to create and manipulate complex class hierarchies in Python.

## Requirements

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Editors | vi, vim, emacs |
| Interpreter | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5) |
| File Endings | All files should end with a new line |
| Shebang | The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3` |
| README | A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory |
| Coding Style | pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) |
| Executable Files | All files must be executable |
| File Length | The length of files will be tested using `wc` |
| Documentation | Modules, classes, and functions should be documented |
| Plagiarism | Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program |

## Project Structure

| Task | Description | File |
|------|-------------|------|
| 0 | Write a function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout | 0-read_file.py |
| 1 | Write a function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written | 1-write_file.py |
| 2 | Write a function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added | 2-append_write.py |
| 3 | Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string) | 3-to_json_string.py |
| 4 | Write a function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string | 4-from_json_string.py |
| 5 | Write a function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation | 5-save_to_json_file.py |
| 6 | Write a function that creates an Object from a "JSON file" | 6-load_from_json_file.py |
| 7 | Write a script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file | 7-add_item.py |
| 8 | Write a function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure for JSON serialization of an object | 8-class_to_json.py |
| 9 | Write a class Student that defines a student | 9-student.py |
| 10 | Write a class Student that defines a student (based on 9-student.py) | 10-student.py |
| 11 | Write a class Student that defines a student (based on 10-student.py) | 11-student.py |
| 12 | Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal's triangle of n | 12-pascal_triangle.py |
| 13 | Write a function that inserts a line of text to a file, after each line containing a specific string | 100-append_after.py |
| 14 | Write a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics | 101-stats.py |
 
## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

* Explain why Python programming is awesome
* Understand and implement inheritance in Python
* Define a class that inherits from another class
* Override methods and attributes from a parent class
* Utilize isinstance, issubclass, type, and super built-in functions
* Implement multiple inheritance and method resolution order
* Understand the differences between built-in objects and user-defined classes
* Create and use instance attributes and methods
* Define and use class attributes
* Implement dynamically created attributes for existing instances of a class

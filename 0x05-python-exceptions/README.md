# 0x05. Python  - Exceptions

## Description
This project covers handling exceptions in Python. It includes tasks aimed at practicing exception handling with `try`, `except`, `finally`, and more. The focus is on handling errors gracefully, ensuring that programs don’t crash due to unexpected input or operations. The project adheres to Pythonic principles and `pycodestyle` standards.

## Requirements
| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Editors** | `vi`, `vim`, `emacs` |
| **Interpreter** | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5) |
| **File Endings** | All files should end with a new line |
| **README** | A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory |
| **Coding Style** | PEP8 (`pycodestyle`) |
| **Global Variables** | Not allowed |
| **Functions per File** | No more than 5 |
| **Allowed Python Standard Library Functions** | `print`, `input` |
| **Header File** | N/A (pure Python project) |

### Python Coding Guidelines
- All Python scripts must be executable.
- All scripts should begin with `#!/usr/bin/python3` as the first line.
- Python code must comply with `pycodestyle` version 2.8.*
- Error handling must be done gracefully to avoid script crashes from unhandled exceptions.

## Tasks
| Task | Description | File |
|------|-------------|------|
| **0** | Print x elements of a list | `0-safe_print_list.py` |
| **1** | Print an integer with `"{:d}".format()` | `1-safe_print_integer.py` |
| **2** | Print and count integers in a list | `2-safe_print_list_integers.py` |
| **3** | Divide two integers and print the result | `3-safe_print_division.py` |
| **4** | Divide elements of two lists | `4-list_division.py` |
| **5** | Raise a type exception | `5-raise_exception.py` |
| **6** | Raise a name exception with a message | `6-raise_exception_msg.py` |

## Advanced Tasks
| Task | Description | File |
|------|-------------|------|
| **100** | Write a function that returns an integer division of two numbers | `100-safe_print_integer_division.py` |
| **101** | Write a function that prints 3 integers, separated by a space | `101-print_multiple_integers.py` |
| **102** | Write a function that computes the square of an integer | `102-square_integer.py` |
| **103** | Write a function that computes the square root of an integer | `103-sqrt_integer.py` |

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Handle exceptions with `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally`
- Work with Python’s built-in exception types
- Handle unexpected input gracefully
- Follow Pythonic principles of writing clean, error-handled code

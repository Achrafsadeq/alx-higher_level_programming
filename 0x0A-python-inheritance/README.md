# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

## Description

This project delves deeper into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, focusing on the concept of inheritance. The tasks are designed to explore various aspects of inheritance, including creating subclasses, overriding methods, and working with multiple inheritance. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of how to create and manipulate complex class hierarchies in Python.

## Requirements

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Editors | vi, vim, emacs |
| Interpreter | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5) |
| File Endings | All files should end with a new line |
| Shebang | The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3` |
| README | A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory |
| Coding Style | pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) |
| Executable Files | All files must be executable |
| File Length | The length of files will be tested using `wc` |
| Documentation | Modules, classes, and functions should be documented |
| Plagiarism | Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program |

## Project Structure 
 
| Task | Description | File |
|------|-------------|------|
| 0 | Write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object | 0-lookup.py |
| 1 | Write a class MyList that inherits from list | 1-my_list.py, tests/1-my_list.txt |
| 2 | Write a function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class; otherwise False | 2-is_same_class.py |
| 3 | Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class; otherwise False | 3-is_kind_of_class.py |
| 4 | Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class; otherwise False | 4-inherits_from.py |
| 5 | Write an empty class BaseGeometry | 5-base_geometry.py |
| 6 | Write a class BaseGeometry (based on 5-base_geometry.py) | 6-base_geometry.py |
| 7 | Write a class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py) | 7-base_geometry.py, tests/7-base_geometry.txt |
| 8 | Write a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py) | 8-rectangle.py |
| 9 | Write a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py) (task based on 8-rectangle.py) | 9-rectangle.py |
| 10 | Write a class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py) | 10-square.py |
| 11 | Write a class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py) (task based on 10-square.py) | 11-square.py |
| 12 | Write a class MyInt that inherits from int | 100-my_int.py |
| 13 | Write a function that adds a new attribute to an object if it's possible | 101-add_attribute.py |

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

* Explain why Python programming is awesome
* Understand and implement inheritance in Python
* Define a class that inherits from another class
* Override methods and attributes from a parent class
* Utilize isinstance, issubclass, type, and super built-in functions
* Implement multiple inheritance and method resolution order
* Understand the differences between built-in objects and user-defined classes
* Create and use instance attributes and methods
* Define and use class attributes
* Implement dynamically created attributes for existing instances of a class

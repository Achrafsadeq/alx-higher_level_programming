# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions


## Description
This project covers the fundamentals of Python control flow using `if/else` statements, loops, and functions. It includes tasks designed to practice Python syntax and logic building, such as handling random numbers, string manipulation, and working with loops and conditionals. The project also focuses on adhering to Pythonic coding principles, using `pycodestyle` for linting.

## Requirements
| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Editors** | `vi`, `vim`, `emacs` |
| **Interpreter** | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5) |
| **File Endings** | All files should end with a new line |
| **README** | A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory |
| **Coding Style** | PEP8 (`pycodestyle`) |
| **Global Variables** | Not allowed |
| **Functions per File** | No more than 5 |
| **Allowed Python Standard Library Functions** | `print`, `input` |
| **Header File** | N/A (pure Python project) |

### Python Coding Guidelines
- All Python scripts must be executable.
- All scripts should begin with `#!/usr/bin/python3` as the first line.
- Python code must comply with `pycodestyle` version 2.8.*
- Error handling must be done gracefully to avoid script crashes from unhandled exceptions.

## Tasks
| Task | Description | File |
|------|-------------|------|
| **0** | Print whether a random number is positive or negative | `0-positive_or_negative.py` |
| **1** | Print the last digit of a random number | `1-last_digit.py` |
| **2** | Print the ASCII alphabet in lowercase | `2-print_alphabet.py` |
| **3** | Print the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding 'q' and 'e' | `3-print_alphabt.py` |
| **4** | Print numbers 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal | `4-print_hexa.py` |
| **5** | Print numbers from 0 to 99 | `5-print_comb2.py` |
| **6** | Print all possible different combinations of two digits | `6-print_comb3.py` |
| **7** | Check for a lowercase character | `7-islower.py` |
| **8** | Print a string in uppercase | `8-uppercase.py` |
| **9** | Print the last digit of a number | `9-print_last_digit.py` |
| **10** | Add two integers and return the result | `10-add.py` |
| **11** | Compute `a` to the power of `b` and return the value | `11-pow.py` |
| **12** | Print numbers from 1 to 100 with Fizz Buzz rules | `12-fizzbuzz.py` |
| **13** | Insert a number into a sorted singly linked list (C programming) | `13-insert_number.c`, `lists.h` |

## Advanced Tasks
| Task | Description | File |
|------|-------------|------|
| **100** | Print the ASCII alphabet in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase | `100-print_tebahpla.py` |
| **101** | Create a copy of the string, removing the character at a specific position | `101-remove_char_at.py` |
| **102** | Write a Python function that does the same as a given Python bytecode | `102-magic_calculation.py` |

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Use `if/else` statements in Python
- Work with loops (`while` and `for`)
- Implement Python functions
- Understand Python's scope of variables
- Handle arithmetic operators in Python
- Use `pycodestyle` to ensure code quality
